## Project description: WeLoveMovies

> You've been hired on as a backend developer at a new startup called WeLoveMovies! As another developer works on the design and frontend experience, you have been tasked with setting up a database and building out specific routes so that users can gain access to data about movies, theaters, and reviews.

## 🤔  Learning objectives  🤔

- Install and use common middleware packages
- Receive requests through routes
- Run tests from the command line
- Access relevant information through route and query parameters
- Create an error handler for the case where a route doesn't exist
- Build an API following RESTful design principles
- Create and customize a knexfile.js file
- Create a connection to your database with Knex
- Write database queries to complete CRUD routes in an Express server
- Return joined and nested data with Knex
- Write database migrations using Knex's migration tool
- Deploy your backend server to a cloud service

You will not need to make any edits to HTML or CSS for this project.

## General tasks

- Your app.js file and server.js file are correctly configured, with your app.js file exporting the application created from Express.
- You use the cors package so that requests from the frontend can correctly reach the backend.
- If a request is made to a route that doesn't exist, the server returns a 404 error.
- If a request is made to a route that exists but the HTTP method is wrong, the server returns a 405 error.
- All of your routes respond with the appropriate status code and use a data key in the response.
